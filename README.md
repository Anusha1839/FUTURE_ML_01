# FUTURE_ML_01
📊 AI-Powered Sales Forecasting Dashboard – Internship Task 1
🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains the complete work for Task 1 of my FutureInterns Machine Learning Internship, focused on building an AI-powered sales forecasting dashboard. The objective of this task is to use historical sales data to predict future sales using machine learning techniques and visualize the insights using Power BI.

🧠 Objectives
Predict future sales using time series forecasting.
Visualize trends in actual vs predicted sales.
Analyze sales patterns across different time frames (monthly/yearly).
Provide insights using Power BI dashboards.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (Google Colab) – For data preprocessing and ML forecasting.
Pandas, Prophet, Scikit-learn – Time series analysis and modeling.
Matplotlib – Basic data visualization in Python.
Power BI – For building dynamic and interactive dashboards.
CSV Files – Used for importing and exporting datasets.

📊 Dashboard Highlights
The Power BI dashboard includes the following visualizations:
📈 Line Chart: Actual vs Predicted Sales over time.
📅 Bar Charts: Monthly and yearly aggregated sales for both actual and predicted values.
🧩 Pie/Donut Charts: Sales distribution by category, sub-category, and region.
🔢 KPI Cards: Total sales, total profit, discount rate.
📊 Clustered Bar Charts: Segment-wise and region-wise sales analysis.
📉 Trend Analysis: Sales trends across months and years.

🔍 Forecasting Approach
Data is loaded and cleaned using Pandas.
Time series forecasting is done using Prophet or Scikit-learn.
Predictions are saved into Forecasted_Sales.csv for Power BI usage.
A new column "Predicted Sales (Cleaned)" is created to fix formatting issues for Power BI compatibility.

✅ How to Use
Run Sales_Forecast_Model.ipynb in Google Colab to generate forecasted sales.
Open the Power BI file SalesForecast_Dashboard.pbix.
Load the datasets: Superstore.csv and Forecasted_Sales.csv.
Review the visualizations using Power BI report view.
